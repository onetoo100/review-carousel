# review-carousel
Simple review carousel


Why the project is useful

	- we can use it in our projects and pages.
	- It's responsive

Important concepts I used:

	- document.querySelector()
	- document.addEventListener()
	- a lot of grid css and flexbox
	- @media to made it responsive
	- background-image in the css and how to position the image
	- a lot about nth-child()
